I have done contributions to the project as followed. Firstly I have done research on how the ideas we had should be coded, this I have forwarded to Richard, due to him being the main coder. During the process I helped debugging and testing the robot.

### Richard
Worked on the main code development of the project, including both the server and client side (Robot service as well as the Robot). Created the main functionality for the server side (functions) as well as the earlier formatting for the index.html.
