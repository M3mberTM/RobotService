### Hongqian Li
I was mainly in charge of making sure everything we did before was properly linked up with what we’re working on now. I helped organize our meetings to keep everyone on the same page and took care of managing our Jira and Confluence setups to track our progress and documentation. My role also involved supporting the team with coding and testing, making sure we got the groundwork done right from the start.

### Julian23000

I have done contributions to the project as followed. Firstly I have done research on how the ideas we had should be coded, this I have forwarded to Richard, due to him being the main coder. During the process I helped debugging and testing the robot.

### Richard
Worked on the main code development of the project, including both the server and client side (Robot service as well as the Robot). Created the main functionality for the server side (functions) as well as the earlier formatting for the index.html.

### Attila
Worked on the look of the webservice design, helped with the integration of the server into the Lego robots functionality(reading and sending data through the server into the database) as well as creating the database and its tables.
